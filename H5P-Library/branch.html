<h2>Iterative Prompt Loop – Branching Scenario</h2>
<p>
You’re designing a 60-minute workshop for faculty who are new to generative AI. Your goal is to help them see AI as a <strong>thinking partner</strong>, not just a shortcut.
</p>
<p>
At each step, choose the <strong>next best move</strong> in the collaboration loop:
<strong>Expand → Evaluate → Refine → Deepen</strong>.
</p>

<div class="box">
  <h3>Step <span id="stepNumber">1</span></h3>
  <div id="stepContent">
    <!-- Dynamic scenario content goes here -->
  </div>
  <div class="choices">
    <p><strong>What should you ask the AI to do next?</strong></p>
    <button data-action="expand">Expand</button>
    <button data-action="evaluate">Evaluate</button>
    <button data-action="refine">Refine</button>
    <button data-action="deepen">Deepen</button>
  </div>
  <div id="feedback"></div>
  <p class="small">Hint: there isn't one "magic" move — but some moves make more sense at certain stages than others.</p>
